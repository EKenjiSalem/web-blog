       <p className="meta-main">
        Over the summer I completed Coursera's Meta Front-End Web Developer Certificate program, with a grade
        of 94%! Congrats to me. But anyway, here's my review of the program.

  
      <ul className="meta-container">  
      <strong> My review will cover the following topics: </strong> 
        <li className="meta-list"> Course Structure  </li>
        <li className="meta-list"> Curriculum </li>

      </ul>

      <h1 className="meta-structure-title"> Course Structure: </h1>
       <div className="meta-structure">
        First off, the program is a fully online and self paced program. The program appears to be aimed at beginers.
        The course is structured with each topic taught in weeks. Within each week there's a combination of 
        reading material, videos, a mini quiz in the middle of the video, quizes after the weeks worth 
        of reading and video materials, and a final and project at the each of each learning topics. Then,
        at the end of the entire section there's a capstone project. Each topic is taught on an average of 4-5 weeks.
      </div>

        <h1 className="meta-structure-title"> Curriculum: </h1>
         <div className="meta-structure">
        The Curriculum consist of Reading materials, Videos, and Quizes. The videos are pre recorder 
        lectures and there are no live office times that a student can go to seek feedback in.
        There is a community chat room where students can ask questions and get feedback from there fellow
        peers. At the end of each learning section, there a project based graded assignment, where if
        you don't pass, you cannot move onto the next topic. So, the curriculum does not seek to hold any
        ones hand and your success is totally up to you, and requires that you dig into the topics and 
        code your own solutions. There is no required text book, at the end of each week there's an 
        additional reading materials sections that links to outside learning resources.
        </div>

        <h1 className="meta-structure-title"> Instructors: </h1>
        <div className="meta-structure">
        The instructors teach pre recorded lectures that are pretty informational. They explain the
        topic of the week and in some instances display a live coding preview of the an aspect of the 
        topic. A good thing that the videos and coding challenges are pretty comprehensive and explainations
        for how to solve the challenges can be found within the vidoes. Altough, the final coding project
        does at times require outside resources, most information can be found within the videos and 
        reading materials.
        </div>

        <h1 className="meta-structure-title"> Job Assistance: </h1>
        <div className="meta-structure">
        One of the cool things about this program, is that Meta created the course, so students 
        have access to the meta job board. Also, at the end of the capstone project, there's 
        a section on how to pass a techinal coding interview. 
        </div>

        <h1 className="meta-structure-title"> Final Thoughts: </h1>
        <div className="meta-structure">
        I think the program is great! I was able to get alot of resourcful information that helped 
        to improve my coding skills, as well as clarify some confusion I had about the web developement
        in general. Will you be job ready at the end of the program? That depends. Refering back 
        to my earlier post about studying daily for weeks and months, holds true for this program as well.
        Truthfully, I'd highly doubt that there is any program that will make you job ready with out 
        you putting in vast amounts of time, energy, and effort to learn the craft.
