        <h1 className="tech-market-title"> Why is Web Development Considered Tech? </h1>

        <p className="tech-market-main">

        "Tech" is short for technology, which broadly refers to the use of scientific knowledge, tools,
         and techniques to create products or systems that enhance and simplify human life.
<br />
<br />
        In a general sense, "tech" often specifically refers to the technology industry, which involves
        the development, production, and application of technology, including hardware, software, and 
        services. 
<br />
<br />
        Areas of tech incldue: Information Technology, Electronics, Biotechnology, Clean Technology,
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, and Telecommunications.
        All of which are essentially creating a form of a physical product for use of service
        or enhancment of some kind. 
<br />
<br />
        My argument with web development, is that while true developers
        are using a coding langugae to create web experiences, there is no physical product being created.
        Web Development is more of an abstract experience that might be liken more towards marketing and social science
<br />
<br />
        In today's modern society, smart phones and tech is everywhere, I mean most people are modern cyborgs with
        phones, tablets, laptops, and vr's. So much so, I feel as if web development should be normalized into the 
        the society as a new study of marketing rather than tech. 
<br />
<br />  
        Let's think about the most popular "Tech" companies: Tesla, Apple, Google, Linkedin, Instagram,  X, (formely Twitter),
        OpenAI, Facebook, and lets say Pinterest. Note: Amazon is technically an ecommerce company. With the exception of
        Apple and Tesla, all of the remaining "Tech" companies are free to social media and informationally
        inclined (meaning that main purpose is abstract knowledge) companies. None of which actually 
        create physical tech products. Therefore, making the current most popular tech companies an abstraction of tech, rather than
        physical touchable pieces of Tech.
<br />
<br />  
        Behind the actual internet, I think that social media is perhaps one of the greatest marketing tools to date. 
        Many might think of the internet and social media as fun, cool, and informational tools to exlpore with,
        yet, as the goal of marketing is to connect with potential customers and convince them of the value of
        a particular product or service. Gaining access to customers is a key aspect of marketing. Where there's
        smoke there's fire, and where are people there are customers. The internet allows unlimted access to a world wide
        net of people. Social media is where the a giant cluster of people are present on a consistent daily basis.
