        <p className="domlearn-main"> 
        My coding journey started back late 2015. When I first started, I started with Codecademy.
        spending a couple of months enaged in learning html, css, javascript. After that I had began
        to learn on Udemy. I started with the Web Development bootcamp, upon completing that I was somewhat
        impressed with udemy's inexpensive way to learn how to code, yet I was still 
        a bit confused, yet still passionate about learning how to code. So I kept learning,
        I enrolled in a couple more web developent programs and began to build my own projects.
<br />
<br />
        After a few years of learning on udemy and evenn building a portfolio and multiple projects,
        I applied for a couple jobs and got rejected, so I continued to engage into another coding
        program Treehouse. At treehouse, I enrolled into the front-end web developent tech degree,
        but dropped out, and just paid to use their coding langauge library which offered self paced programs.
<br />
<br />
       Finally, I get to the point. All of the javascript programs had 1 think in common. The DOM was never
       one of the first things to be taught. Know the Dom can a very complex process, but the DOM is the 
       very thing connects HTML and CSS to Javascript. Noted there are inline methods that can be applied,
       yet the DOM appears to be the preffered way to bring functionality to HTML and CSS.
<br />
<br />
      When I first started, I remember learning about variables, data types, operators, loops, 
      functions, if statements, and then the dom. In doing so, I recall that's why I was so confused.
      Becuase, I had Learned all of these prgramming concepts without learning how this will apply 
      to a web page. When I was first made aware of the DOM, I thought this was another programming 
      concept. After months digging through, I realized that DOM is the very connector from 
      prgramming to the browser.
<br />
<br />
      With this new found logic, I opted to post the DOM as one of the top articles, to help 
      someone who might run into the same issues. The DOM is the bridge between web page simplcity
      and web page complexity. Really without the DOM, is web development still considered tech?
      at that point HTML and CSS is really just web design. Web Design is awesome. The very
      foundation of an enaging web experience, yet Javascript is that very thing that gives the
      web page that 3d wow factor. So, thank you reading my rant, but I remain strong that the 
      DOM should be one of the first taught in Javascript.
